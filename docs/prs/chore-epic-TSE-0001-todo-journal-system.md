# chore(epic-TSE-0001): standardize git quality standards and documentation

## Summary

This PR standardizes the git quality standards infrastructure in risk-monitor-py by adding validation scripts, GitHub Actions workflows, and markdown linting configuration. It also archives completed milestones from TODO.md to TODO-HISTORY.md as part of the TODO journal system implementation.

**Key Changes:**

- Added git quality standards scripts (validate-all.sh, pre-push-hook.sh, create-pr.sh)
- Added GitHub Actions workflows for automated PR validation
- Configured markdownlint for consistent documentation formatting
- Archived completed milestones to TODO-HISTORY.md
- Updated TODO.md with Git Quality Standards completion milestone

## What Changed

### Git Quality Standards Scripts

**New Scripts Added:**

- `scripts/validate-all.sh` - Comprehensive validation script checking branch names, PR documentation, markdown linting
- `scripts/pre-push-hook.sh` - Git pre-push hook for enforcing quality standards

### Repository Context

This is part of epic TSE-0001 Foundation work to establish consistent git workflows, validation standards, and documentation practices across all repositories in the trading ecosystem. The risk-monitor-py service follows the same patterns as other services in the ecosystem.

## Testing

### Validation Tests

- [x] Run `bash scripts/validate-all.sh` - passes all checks
- [x] Verify PR documentation exists for current branch
- [x] Confirm markdown linting passes
- [x] Verify TODO.md exists and is valid
- [x] Test pre-push hook logic (dry run)
- [x] Verify GitHub Actions workflows are properly configured

### Cross-Repository Verification

- [x] Verified checksums match across all repositories
- [x] Confirmed script standardization successful
- [x] Tested validation in multiple repositories
- [x] Verified TODO-HISTORY.md archival pattern

### Functional Tests

- [x] All 52 existing tests still passing
- [x] Service starts and responds to health checks
- [x] No regressions in service functionality
