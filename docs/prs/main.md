# Pull Request: Git Quality Standards Simplification and TODO Journal System

**Branch**: `main`
**Base**: `main`
**Epic**: TSE-0001 - Foundation Services & Infrastructure
**Type**: Chore (Process Improvement)
**Component**: trading-system-engine-py
**Status**: âœ… Ready for Review

---

## Summary

This PR implements two related improvements to repository management:

1. **Simplified PR Documentation Matching**: Removed complex PR matching logic with multiple fallbacks
2. **TODO Journal System**: Created TODO-HISTORY.md to archive completed milestones

These changes improve predictability and maintainability of git validation scripts across the trading ecosystem.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Git Validation Scripts Simplified

**Scripts Updated**:
- `create-pr.sh` - Removed PR prefix mapping and epic pattern matching
- `validate-all.sh` - Accept TODO.md OR TODO-MASTER.md
- `pre-push-hook.sh` - Single BRANCH_FILENAME pattern only
- `validate-repository.sh` - Exact branch name matching only

**Before** (Complex with 3 fallback mechanisms):
```bash
# 1. PR prefix mapping (featureâ†’feat, refactorâ†’refac, etc.)
# 2. Epic pattern matching: docs/prs/${PR_PREFIX}-epic-*.md
# 3. Manual selection from multiple matches
```

**After** (Simple single-pattern):
```bash
BRANCH_FILENAME=$(echo "$CURRENT_BRANCH" | sed 's/\//-/g')
# Check: docs/prs/${BRANCH_FILENAME}.md
```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… Predictable: PR file name always matches branch name (with / â†’ -)
- âœ… No false matches: No more "Multiple PR docs found" prompts
- âœ… Clear errors: Exact expected file path shown when missing
- âœ… Consistent: Same logic across all validation scripts

### 2. TODO Journal System

**Files Created/Updated**:
- `TODO-HISTORY.md` - Archive for completed milestones
- `TODO.md` - Updated with reference header, focused on active work

**Pattern**:
```markdown
# trading-system-engine-py TODO

> **Note**: Completed milestones are archived in [TODO-HISTORY.md](./TODO-HISTORY.md). 
> This file tracks active and future work.
```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… Focused TODO files: Only active/future work visible
- âœ… Historical record: Completed work preserved with context
- âœ… Better navigation: Smaller files, faster to scan
- âœ… Clear status: Obvious separation between done and todo

---

## Testing

### Validation Suite
```bash
# Run full validation
bash scripts/validate-all.sh
# Expected: All checks pass

# Test PR matching
bash scripts/create-pr.sh
# Expected: Finds PR file by exact branch name match
```

### Pre-push Hook
```bash
# Simulate pre-push validation
bash .git/hooks/pre-push
# Expected: All 7 checks pass
```

---

## Impact

### Breaking Changes
None - this is purely a validation script enhancement.

### Backward Compatibility
- PR files continue to work with same naming convention
- Scripts accept both TODO.md and TODO-MASTER.md
- No changes to external APIs or workflows
